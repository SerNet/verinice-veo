/**
 * A unit is high level group of elements defined by organizational structure. Units may contain
 * other units. For instance, a unit could be a division, a department or a project. Unit is a
 * component that defines ownership and primary responsibility. An organizational unit. Units may
 * have sub-units. Every element object is assigned to exactly one unit at all times. When the unit
 * is deleted, all its elements will be deleted as well. A unit defines object ownership. Small and
 * medium organizations may just have one unit. Large enterprises may have multiple units for
 * different subsidiaries. Service providers might have one unit for each client that is using the
 * software. A unit always belongs to exactly one client. This means that every element also
 * transitively belongs to exactly one client. Units cannot be moved between clients. The {@link
 * Scope} object is much more flexible and the preferred choice to group elements together for
 * business modeling purposes. Units should exclusively be used to model ownership and high-level
 * access restrictions.
